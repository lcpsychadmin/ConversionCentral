--- Enhancements to Existing Code ---

1. [DONE] combine applications and the source catalog into one page and move the page to the Data Connections Menu Item and call it Source Systems
2. [DONE] Reorder the Page Links under Data Connections as follows
	a. Application Database
	b. Data Warehouse
	c. Source Systems
	d. Ingestion Schedules
3. [DONE] Add in better filter capabilities in the ingestion schedules page. This will grow as we add more source systems into the application. Perhaps add in
a Tree view at the top that is by source system, connection, and then schema
4. [DONE] in the data definition table set Enterprise Attribute to a Yes/No field. The field type should be a drop down of the available data types in the Databricks SQL Warehouse. Grey out Decimal places unless a float/decimal field type is used. Legal/Regulatory Requirements and Security Classifications should be dropdown boxes based on new models for each. The admin pages for both should be under the application settings menu item.
5. On the report designer page, rename the publish to data object button to publish to report catalog
6. Ensure that the sql that is run in the reporting designer runs on the databricks server. This will mean that we need to change the tables that are available for reporting should only be from tables in databricks
7. Add a sub menu item under Data Configuration labled "Data Definition Settings" and move the Legal Requirements and SEcurity Classifications page under this menu
8. Move the Data Management menu item below Data Configuration
